What is jDbT ?
--------------

jDbT is a python-based tools that aims at easing the design and the deployment
of Relational Databases.

jDbT is able to build different kinds of representations of the database from
a single YAML input file.

jDbT can output in these formats :
 * SQL (MySQL implementation)
 * SQL (PostGreSQL implementation)
 * Propel-compliant XML
 * Physical Diagram (dot)
 * Physical Diagram (png)

The input file syntax tries to take the most from 
Convention over Configuration principles. Thus, the input file stays small and
you can focus on higher-level tasks.

Roadmap
